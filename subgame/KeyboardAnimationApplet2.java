    The KeyboardAnimation2 applet provides a generic framework for applets
    both display an animation and respond to keyboard events.  The animation
    runs only when the applet has the keyboard focus and can respond to 
    key presses.  The appearance of the applet changes, depending on whether
    it has the keyboard focus.  Note that each time a new frame of the 
    animation is to be displayed, it is drawn completely from scratch.
    When the applet has the keyboard focus, a cyan border is drawn around
    it.  When it does not have the keyboard focus, the border is in
    the applet's background color and a message "Click to activate" is
    displayed in the applet's foreground color and font.

    This class would be appropriate, for example, as a basis for a typical
    arcade game, such as Space Invaders.  (Except that the performance
    might not be good on a slow machine.)
    
    To use this framework, define a subclass of KeyboardAnimationApplet2 and
    override the drawFrame() method.  This method is responsible for drawing
    one frame of the animation.  If you need to some initialization at the
    time the applet is created, override the doInitialization() method.
    This method is called once when the applet is created.  You should
    not override the standard applet methods init(), start(), and stop()
    unless you call the inherited versions from this class.
    
    In this class, the applet is already set up to "listen" for keyboard
    events.  To make your applet respond to keyboard events, you should
    override one or more of the methods keyPressed(), keyReleased(),
    and keyTyped().  The applet also listens for MouseEvents, and you
    can override the mouse handling events if you want.  But if you do
    override mousePressed(), be sure to call super.mousePressed() which
    will request the input focus.
    
    To respond to key presses, you should have some instance variables
    that affect the image drawn.  Change these variables in the keyPressed,
    keyReleased, or keyTyped methods.
    
    (Alternatively, instead of defining a subclass, you could copy this
    file, change its name and the name of the class, and edit it.)
    
    When this file is compiled, two class files are produced:
    KeyboardAnimationApplet2.class and KeyboardAnimationApplet2$1.class.
    Both class files are necessary to use the applet.

    NOTE:  This program requires Java 1.2 or higher.  It is based on an older 
    program, KeyboardAnimationApplet.java, which has essentially the same 
    functionality but which worked with Java 1.1.
