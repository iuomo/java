Newton's method of approximating the imaginary roots to x^4 -1

I wrote this java code using the following constructors:

INewtonMethod (double a, double bi, int root, long limit) 
	// this class is the main engine to calculate x2 = x1 - f(x) / f'(x)  where x is a complex number in the form of a + bi
DivideImaginary(double na,double nbi,double da, double dbi) 
	// this class was needed to divide imaginaries
Iproduct (double a, double bi,int exp) 
	// this class was need to compute (a+bi)^n  where n is 4 in this case

and then a class called ColorArray builds a two dimensional array as follows:

class ColorArray{
		int rgb[][] = new int[3][40]; 

		
		int[][] color(){
					int c,v,red,green,blue;
		int radj;int gadj;int badj;
		
		red = 0;green = 0;blue = 0;
		radj = 13;gadj = 0;badj = 12;
			for (v = 0; v < 31; v ++){
				red = red + radj;
				green = green + gadj;
				blue = blue + badj;
			if (red > 255) red = 0; if (red < 0) red = 255;
				if (green > 255) green = 0; if (green < 0)green = 255;
				if (blue > 255) blue = 0; if (blue < 0) blue= 255;
				rgb[0][v] = red;rgb[1][v] = green;rgb[2][v] = blue;
			}
				return rgb;
		}
	}
